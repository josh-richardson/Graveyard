Listing of projects:
SpacesHelper - a tool for Windows 10 which makes use of various libraries and some hacked-together WINAPI calls to do its best to programatically transfer windows from one Windows 10 virtual desktop to another (virtual desktops on Windows 10 are different to those on previous version of Windows). As the API provided by Microsoft doesn't actually let you move windows belonging to other processes, the approach here uses color scraping and WINAPI calls. The hotkeys are Alt+X and Alt+c which (try) to transfer the currently selected window to the previous and next desktop respectively. 
This project is in this section because of the fact that it does not work reliably - everything works up until selecting the correct desktop to transfer to. As the "Task Switcher" window does not respond to WINAPI calls, this has to be done by simulating input. The only way to then ensure that the correct ContextMenuItem is selected (the ContextMenu does not show up in spyxx) is to check by color scraping. This could be implemented but due to differing screen resolutions would have to be implemented quite robustly, which would in turn take rather a lot of time. I have decided that the potential expended effort is not worth the potential utility gained. Thus this project lies dormant. Plus the code is largely awful, cobbled together from other places, and not split up into any subclasses/etc.
